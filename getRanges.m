function [iStart, iEnd] = getRanges(a)
    % a is a vector of boolean values.  This routine returns the indices of
    % the start and end of runs of true values.

    % ensure a is a row vector
    a = reshape(a, [1,length(a)]);
    % get the diff %TEMP!!! can just use diff()
    e = a - [a(1), a(1:(end-1))];
    % starts are where we have false to true transitions
    iStart = find(e == 1);
    % ends occur just before a true to false transition.
    iEnd = find(e == -1) - 1;

    % handle initial and final values.
